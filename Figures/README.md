# Quantum Dot Figures

Here, you will find the published pictures of the 
- Quantum Dots wavefunctions (wavefunctions),
- the electron transfer between the semiconductor quantum dot and the adsorbed molecule, and 
- The assymetry factor of light adsorption by the modeled developted in our grouo: charge transfer (CT), the experimental data, and normal dipol-diple interaction theory.
